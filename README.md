
### Project Name: Great Adventure

### Project Overview:
"Final Adventure" is a Python-based interactive storytelling project. The primary goal is to create a "Choose Your Own Adventure" experience where users make meaningful choices that influence the progression of the story.

### Technologies:
- Python

### Project Structure:
The project comprises two main components:

1. Interactive Storytelling Engine (Python files):
   - The engine consists of one or more Python files responsible for displaying the text-based story, accepting user input, determining the next stage of the story based on user choices, and allowing the user to exit the adventure.
   - The Python code will serve as the backbone for the interactive storytelling experience, orchestrating the flow of the narrative.

2. Story Files (Plain text files - .txt):
   - The actual story content is stored in plain text files. These files contain the specific, interesting narrative that users will navigate through.
   - Each text file represents a stage or decision point in the adventure, and the content of the files provides the textual descriptions and options for the user.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the Repository:
   - Users can clone the repository containing the Python files and story text files.

2. Run the Python Engine:
   - Execute the Python files to start the interactive storytelling engine.

3. Navigate the Adventure:
   - Users will read the story descriptions and make choices based on the options presented.
   - The engine will dynamically determine the next stage of the story based on user choices.

4. Quit or Explore Further:
   - Users can decide to exit the adventure at any point or continue exploring the narrative by making different choices.

### Accessibility:
"Final Adventure" is designed to be accessible to anyone interested in interactive storytelling. Users can easily navigate the adventure using simple input commands, making it an engaging and enjoyable experience for a broad audience.

### Note:
- Ensure that both the Python files and story text files (.txt) are in the same directory for the engine to interact with the story content correctly.
